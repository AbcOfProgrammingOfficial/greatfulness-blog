<p>Being an introvert made me realise some stuff that helped to</p>
<p>develope in a different way, yes I got to deal with a lot of unpleasant situations because of this,</p>
<p>but because not feeeling the need to be liked by everyone, you can spend more time on your hobbies.</p>
<p>   This is also a reason why i got a lot of hobbies, such as: programming or photography or even learning about history.</p>
<p>   Hobbies can literally be some assets, cause right now you invest into learning something new, </p>
<p>but later on, what you learnt will be useful, from day to day life to even getting a job.</p>
<p> Or even when just interacting with somebody, having hobbies and being knowledgeable can give some grat opportunities</p>
<p>So yes, spending time on your hobbies can pretty much give you an advantage in life and it's very productive</p>
<p>cause you can relax and improve yourself at the same time.<p>
