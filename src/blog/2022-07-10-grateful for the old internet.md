<p>I'm grateful for the old ineternet because it used to be simple and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Back when we used to build websites manually, we were happy just if the site looked nice</p>
<p>and didn't required a lot of bandwidth.</p>
<br>
<p>But also social media, a few years ago was somewhat enjoyable, nowadays</p>
<p>it's just trash, and that's why i decided to leave most of the social networks</p>
<p>and built this blog instead.</p>
<br>
<p>The point of this blog is for me to keep journaling and also being able to show it to</p>
<p>my friends and to edit the post if i misspell a word or something.</p>
